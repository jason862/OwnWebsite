      <h2> If I am eating the candy I am trying to sell, what can I do to prevent me from eating it? </h2>
      <p> If you are eating the candy you are trying to sell for money, there are many things you can do. The first thing you can do is you can 
        hang up a picture of what you are trying to save up money for so before you eat your candy, you can think of the thing you want to buy
        and you can put away the candy. Putting away the candy will then allow you to sell the candy and to make money to get what you want. </p>
